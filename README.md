# BasHacks
Because I was tired of doing it again every damn time.

### What is BasHacks
It is mayble the most simple project (if you could call it a project) I have ever made.

It is basically some scripts to be sourced by bash inside your `.bashrc` (you can change it) but automated and with a backup in my GitHub so if I format my Linux I can easily have it working again.

### How to use it
Clone the repository and run the `install.sh` which will add some `source` commands in your `.bashrc` sourcing all files inside the folder `hacks/`.

### Contributing
Just open the damn pull request!
